# RiderParse

**RiderParse** is a work-in-progress software library for aggregating and processing payslips from different platforms. 
<br />
It attempts to expand on the functionality of the already completed RooParse project by creating a framework for processing payslips from different providers.
<br />
It tries to address the challenge of varying formats and resolution of data provided in different workplaces, and how to best analyse and aggregate pay data across different platforms.
<br />
This is not a complete application such as RooParse, but rather an attempt to address the challenges of unifying data under a common framework.
<br />
This project may be useful to developers working on applications with a similar purpose as RooParse, as they may be able to adapt it to their purposes by implementing it into an application for the end user.
